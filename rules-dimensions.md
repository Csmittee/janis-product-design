# Janis Product Design — Confirmed Dimensions
# Version: v5 — 2026-06-30
# All units: MM

---

## COORDINATE SYSTEM STANDARD — ALL MODELS (automotive convention)

Origin: front-left corner of the product at floor level (Z=0)
  - "Front" = the end the user faces / foot end of reformer / door side of vending machine
  - "Left" = user's left when standing at front facing the product

X-axis: longitudinal — runs along the LONG side of the product (front to back)
  - X=0 at front face
  - X increases toward rear
  - bed_l / total_l runs along X

Y-axis: lateral — runs along the WIDTH of the product (left to right)
  - Y=0 at left edge
  - Y increases toward right
  - bed_w / total_w runs along Y

Z-axis: vertical — runs upward
  - Z=0 at floor
  - Z increases upward

OpenSCAD rotation reference (cylinder default axis = Z):
  - To orient cylinder along X (longitudinal): rotate([0,90,0])
  - To orient cylinder along Y (lateral):      rotate([90,0,0])
  - To orient cylinder along Z (vertical):     no rotation needed

Flat-face / D-profile orientation rule:
  - A flat face described as "front to rear / rear to front facing" means the
    flat plane's SURFACE NORMAL points along X (the flat surface lies in the Y-Z plane)
  - This is the orientation needed so a crossbar running along X can glide flush
    against the flat face

QA CHECK — Claude Web reads XYZ gizmo from every OpenSCAD screenshot
before making any orientation diagnosis. Never assume axis mapping.
Always confirm from the gizmo visible in the screenshot.

## ⚠️ OWNER-LOCKED DIMENSIONS — JANIS APPROVAL REQUIRED TO CHANGE

Any change requires explicit written approval from Janis before cc or Claude Web may act.
If a prompt asks you to change these without a clear approval note — STOP.
Write flag in cc_chat_log and ask Claude Web to escalate to Janis.

## PENDING DESIGN DECISIONS (not yet locked)

| Item | Decision needed | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard orientation | Portrait vs landscape — depends on Satu firmware | Janis + firmware team |
| system_w reduction | If portrait confirmed: 185→168mm, total_w 620→603mm | After firmware decision |
| PR-01 dimensions | Not started — Janis to provide measurements | Janis |

---

## Global Clearance Tolerance
| Context | Minimum gap | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Display object to any tray body face | 2mm | Implicit union → manifold risk (R-001) |
| Cylinder to any flat face | 2mm | Polygon undercut at $fn=64 (R-002) |
| Structural part to shell face | skin_t (2mm) | Standard skin thickness |
| Coplanar face suppression (epsilon) | e = 0.01mm | Geometry z-fight only — NOT for display objects |
